## BUILDING

First, install the build tool. The easiest way is to grab them with curl:

> curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh

If this feels insecure, go to https://docs.haskellstack.org/ and pick a more suitable
option.

Then build the project with `stack build`. 

## USE

After building this you can start the plugins with:

> stack exec ChoicesPlugin -- -p<port_number>

and 

> stack exec MultipleChoicesPlugin -- -p<port_number>

## Installation

Sorry, no install script yet. You need to grab all .js, *.html and *.css files as well as the binaries.
The command `stack path --local-install-root` will tell you where the binaries are. You can also build
a docker container for the plugins with `stack image container`
